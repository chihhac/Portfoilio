       " 'During an inspection of Medtronic Puerto Rico Operations Company (MPROC), located at Ceiba Norte Industrial Park, 50 Road 31, Km 24.4, Juncos, Puerto Rico, on April 23 through May 15, 2018, investigators from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that Medtronic MPROC Juncos manufactures implantable pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization devices, and other related products. Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body.',\n",
       " 'This inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820. You may find the Act and FDA’s regulations through links in FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov. We received your firm’s responses dated June 6 and July 13, 2018, concerning our investigators’ observations noted on the Form FDA 483 (FDA 483), Inspectional Observations, issued to your firm on May 15, 2018. We address these responses below in relation to violations observed during the inspection, which include: 1.    Failure to validate a process whose results cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection and test according to established procedures, which is required by 21 CFR 820.75(a). Specifically, (b)(4) processes (b)(4) were not validated on Blackwell implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs). These (b)(4) processes (b)(4) in ICDs that failed due to high voltage arcing. This led to your firm’s recall Z-0582/9-2018.  We reviewed your firm’s responses to the FDA 483 and acknowledge your commitment to: (a) (b)(4) process steps (b)(4), (b) update supplemental material for process validation to clarify that each (b)(4) must be assessed and challenged during process validation, (c) update the change control process to incorporate instructions on how to assess risk or unintended consequence of (b)(4), (d) assess (b)(4) processes for ICDs to determine if they were properly validated and have adequate process controls, and (e) perform an assessment of process validations for Blackwell ICDs non-fully verifiable processes to evaluate if applicable product specifications were challenged per process validation and design transfer requirements. Your responses appear to be adequate; however, some of your firm’s actions are still in progress, and a follow-up inspection by FDA will be necessary to verify compliance. 2.   Failure to document (b)(4) activities in the device history record (DHR) as required by 21 CFR 820.90(b)(2). Specifically, (b)(4) on implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) was not documented in device history records. We reviewed your firm’s responses to the FDA 483 and acknowledge your commitment to: (a) (b)(4) process, (b) update product identification and traceability procedures to clarity that (b)(4) must be documented, (c) update your training of new hires and manufacturing personnel, (d) assess manufacturing areas to identify whether similar conduct is occurring elsewhere, and (e) establish more robust equipment and/or procedure controls on ICD equipment used in manufacturing to help prevent the occurrence of undocumented (b)(4). Your responses appear to be adequate; however, some of your firm’s actions are still in progress, and a follow-up inspection by FDA will be necessary to verify compliance. Your firm should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice. These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties.  Also, federal agencies may be advised of the issuance of Warning Letters about devices so that they may take this information into account when considering the award of contracts. Additionally, premarket approval applications for Class III devices to which the Quality System regulation violations are reasonably related will not be approved until the violations have been corrected.  Requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments will not be granted until the violations related to the subject devices have been corrected.',\n",
       " 'Please notify this office in writing within fifteen (15) business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to correct the noted violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again.  Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken.  If your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities.  If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen (15) business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Your firm’s response should be comprehensive and address all violations included in this Warning Letter. Additionally, our investigators cited observations on the FDA 483 in the areas of corrective and preventive action (21 CFR 820.100), acceptance activities (21 CFR 820.80), statistical techniques (21 CFR 820.250), and inspection, measuring, and test equipment (21 CFR 820.72).

       " 'Dear Mr. Rousseau: During an inspection of your firm located in Sylmar, CA,on February 7 through February 17, 2017, investigators from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that your firm manufactures the Fortify, Unify, Assura (including Quadra) implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators, and the Merlin@home monitor.  Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or function of the body.',\n",
       " 'This inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System (QS) regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820. We received a response from Vishnu Charan, Vice President of Operations, dated March 13, 2017, concerning our investigator’s observations noted on the Form FDA 483 (FDA 483), List of Inspectional Observations that was issued to your firm. We address this response below, in relation to each of the noted violations. These violations include, but are not limited to, the following:',\n",
       " '1.      Failure to establish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective and preventive actions, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a). For example:',\n",
       " 'a.  FDA reviewed 42 of your firm’s Product Analysis Reports, produced between 2011 and 2014. These reports showed, in instances when your supplier’s analysis provided evidence that lithium cluster bridging had prematurely drained the battery, your firm repeatedly concluded that the cause of premature depletion of Greatbatch QHR2850 batteries “could not be determined.”  Your firm later categorized these as “unconfirmed” lithium bridges. Your firm’s Corrective Action and Preventive Action (CAPA) Procedure, (b)(4), Revision AA states, in Section 2.0, the level of corrective action and preventive action shall be commensurate with the significance and risk of the nonconformance. Further, Section 5.0 states the risk evaluation of nonconformances is based on three factors: severity, probability, and detectability.   By basing your firm’s risk evaluation on “confirmed” cases and not considering the potential for “unconfirmed” cases to have been shorts, your firm underestimated the occurrence of the hazardous situation. This delayed initiation of CAPA #13-017 Titled: Lithium Clusters Shorts in M2850 Cells, until December 18, 2013, and your firm continued to distribute devices containing this battery until October 2016.',\n",
       " 'The adequacy of your firm’s response cannot be determined at this time. Your firm provided a summary of, and implementation dates for, several corrections, corrective actions, and systemic corrective actions. However, in your firm’s response, you failed to provide evidence of implementation for your firm’s corrections, corrective actions, and systemic corrective actions. ',\n",
       " 'b.  Section 5 of both your SJM Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) SOP, (b)(4),  Revision D, and SJM Corrective and Preventive Action WI, (b)(4),  Revision C, defines your firm’s CAPA process and the supporting procedures and forms associated with activities performed within your firm’s CAPA process. Additionally, Figure 2 in your firm’s SJM Corrective and Preventive Action WI, (b)(4),  Revision C, describes the CAPA Risk Assessment and Resolution Process that proceeds after a CAPA file is opened.  Your firm failed to follow its CAPA procedures when evaluating a third party report, dated August 25, 2016, in that your firm released Merlin@home Cybersecurity Risk Assessment (b)(4), , Revision G, an updated risk assessment and its corresponding corrective action, Merlin@home EX2000 v.8.2.2, (pilot release on December 7, 2016 with full release on January 9, 2017), before approving the CAPA request for this issue, CAPA#17012 Titled: CRM Product Cybersecurity, on February 7, 2017.  Your firm conducted a risk assessment and a corrective action outside of your CAPA system. Your firm did not confirm all required corrective and preventive actions were completed, including a full root cause investigation and the identification of actions to correct and prevent recurrence of potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities, as required by your CAPA procedures. Additionally, your firm did not confirm that verification or validation activities for the corrective actions had been completed, to ensure the corrective actions were effective and did not adversely affect the finished device.',\n",

',\n",
       " 'c.  Your management review and medical advisory boards did not receive relevant and complete information concerning the premature battery depletion issue, as required by Section 5.3 your firm’s procedure, Quality Management Review SOP (b)(4),  Revision R. On November 11 and November 12, 2014, two separate presentations were provided for management review and to your MAB for review concerning premature battery depletions. The presentation to your firm’s MAB included rates of occurrence of premature battery depletions caused by “confirmed” lithium cluster formations. The presentation did not include information on the potential for “unconfirmed” cases to be shorts, despite possessing evidence provided by your supplier regarding premature battery depletion caused by lithium bridges. This resulted in significant underestimations of the probability of occurrence of the hazardous situation. Additionally, both presentations stated there were no serious injury or death directly related to lithium cluster formations. However, the first related death to this issue occurred on (b)(6) (MDR#2938836-2014-13599). Your firm completed its returned device analysis, related to this death, on August 27, 2014. The analysis concluded the cause of premature battery depletion “could not be determined” despite evidence of lithium bridges, provided by your supplier. This death was not disclosed in these presentations for management or MAB review. ',\n",

       " '2.      Failure to establish and maintain procedures to control product that does not conform to specified requirements, as required by 21 CFR 820.90(a).   For example: On October 11, 2016,  your firm initiated a recall for your firm’s Fortify, Unify, and Assura Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillators (CRT-Ds) due to premature battery depletion. Subsequently, ten implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs), subject to this recall, were shipped from your firm’s distribution centers to St. Jude US Field Representatives. Between October 14 and October 26, 2016, an additional seven ICDs, also subject to this recall and in the control of St. Jude US Field Representatives, were implanted into patients.   ',\n",

       " '3.      Failure to ensure that design verification shall confirm that the design output meets the design input requirements, as required by 21 CFR 820.30(f). For example: Your firm has a design input, (b)(4),  of “the Remote Monitoring device shall only open network ports to authorized interfaces” which is documented in Merlin@home EX2000 (b)(4) Software System Requirements Specification, Document (b)(4). This is implemented as a design output in your firm’s Merlin@home Software Requirements Specification Uploads (b)(4).',\n",

According to your firm’s testing procedures, (b)(4), Final Configuration Test Procedures, (b)(4) and Final Configuration Test Procedures Document (b)(4),  the requirement was only partially verified by testing that the network ports opened with an authorized interface.   Your testing procedures did not require full verification to ensure the network ports would not open with an unauthorized interface.    ',\n",

       " 'a.  Your firm failed to accurately incorporate the findings of a third-party assessment you commissioned, dated April 2, 2014, into your firm’s updated cybersecurity risk assessments for your high voltage and peripheral devices. Specifically:',\n",
       " '1.      Your firm’s updated Cybersecurity Risk Assessments, (b)(4) Cybersecurity Risk Assessment, (b)(4), , Revision A, April 2, 2015 and Merlin@home Product Security Risk Assessment, (b)(4), Revision B, May 21, 2014 failed to accurately incorporate the third party report’s findings into its security risk ratings, causing your post-mitigation risk estimations to be acceptable, when, according to the report, several risks were not adequately controlled.2.      The same report identified the hardcoded universal unlock code as an exploitable hazard for your firm’s High Voltage devices.  Your firm’s Global Risk Management Procedure, SOP (b)(4),  Section 5.3.3 of Revision T, Released November 2, 2012, and Section 5.1.3 of Revision X, Released November 8, 2016, requires your firm to assess if new hazards are introduced, or previously identified hazardous situations are affected, by risk control measures. Your firm identified the hardcoded universal unlock code as a risk control measure for emergent communication. However, you failed to identify this risk control also as a hazard.  Therefore, you failed to properly estimate and evaluate the risk associated with the hardcoded universal lock code in the design of your High Voltage devices. ',\n",

This analysis included evidence of lithium ion cluster formation. However, your firm failed to identify lithium clusters as a hazardous situation and a potential cause of premature battery depletion, through its risk management process. This process is used for batteries that are used in the Unify, Fortify, Assura, and Quadra ICDs and CRT-Ds. ',\n",

       " 'During an inspection of Medtronic Puerto Rico Operations Company (MPROC), located at Ceiba Norte Industrial Park, 50 Road 31, Km 24.4, Juncos, Puerto Rico, on April 23 through May 15, 2018, investigators from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that Medtronic MPROC Juncos manufactures implantable pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization devices, and other related products. Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body.',\n",
       " 'This inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820. You may find the Act and FDA’s regulations through links in FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov. We received your firm’s responses dated June 6 and July 13, 2018, concerning our investigators’ observations noted on the Form FDA 483 (FDA 483), Inspectional Observations, issued to your firm on May 15, 2018. We address these responses below in relation to violations observed during the inspection, which include: 1.    Failure to validate a process whose results cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection and test according to established procedures, which is required by 21 CFR 820.75(a). Specifically, (b)(4) processes (b)(4) were not validated on Blackwell implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs). These (b)(4) processes (b)(4) in ICDs that failed due to high voltage arcing. This led to your firm’s recall Z-0582/9-2018.  We reviewed your firm’s responses to the FDA 483 and acknowledge your commitment to: (a) (b)(4) process steps (b)(4), (b) update supplemental material for process validation to clarify that each (b)(4) must be assessed and challenged during process validation, (c) update the change control process to incorporate instructions on how to assess risk or unintended consequence of (b)(4), (d) assess (b)(4) processes for ICDs to determine if they were properly validated and have adequate process controls, and (e) perform an assessment of process validations for Blackwell ICDs non-fully verifiable processes to evaluate if applicable product specifications were challenged per process validation and design transfer requirements. Your responses appear to be adequate; however, some of your firm’s actions are still in progress, and a follow-up inspection by FDA will be necessary to verify compliance. 2.   Failure to document (b)(4) activities in the device history record (DHR) as required by 21 CFR 820.90(b)(2). Specifically, (b)(4) on implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) was not documented in device history records. We reviewed your firm’s responses to the FDA 483 and acknowledge your commitment to: (a) (b)(4) process, (b) update product identification and traceability procedures to clarity that (b)(4) must be documented, (c) update your training of new hires and manufacturing personnel, (d) assess manufacturing areas to identify whether similar conduct is occurring elsewhere, and (e) establish more robust equipment and/or procedure controls on ICD equipment used in manufacturing to help prevent the occurrence of undocumented (b)(4). Your responses appear to be adequate; however, some of your firm’s actions are still in progress, and a follow-up inspection by FDA will be necessary to verify compliance. Your firm should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice. These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties.  Also, federal agencies may be advised of the issuance of Warning Letters about devices so that they may take this information into account when considering the award of contracts. Additionally, premarket approval applications for Class III devices to which the Quality System regulation violations are reasonably related will not be approved until the violations have been corrected.  Requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments will not be granted until the violations related to the subject devices have been corrected.',\n",
       " 'Please notify this office in writing within fifteen (15) business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to correct the noted violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again.  Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken.  If your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities.  If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen (15) business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Your firm’s response should be comprehensive and address all violations included in this Warning Letter. Additionally, our investigators cited observations on the FDA 483 in the areas of corrective and preventive action (21 CFR 820.100), acceptance activities (21 CFR 820.80), statistical techniques (21 CFR 820.250), and inspection, measuring, and test equipment (21 CFR 820.72).  Your firm’s responses appear to adequately address these observations. Implementation and effectiveness of your corrective actions will be evaluated during a follow-up inspection. If you have questions regarding this letter, please contact Timothy G. Philips, Compliance Officer, by telephone at 612-758-7133, or by e-mail at Timothy.Philips@fda.hhs.gov. Please send your reply to this Warning Letter to Blake Bevill, Program Division Director, using the electronic mailbox ORADevices2FirmResponse@fda.hhs.gov. Any attachments should be labeled and/or identified for ease of review. Documentation should be submitted as a single pdf file, with bookmarks to easily identify table of contents, memos, attachments, etc.   If a single pdf file exceeds the 100MB size limit, please submit multiple pdf files, as appropriate. Refer to CMS Case #560736 when replying. Finally, you should know that this letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations at your firm’s facility.  It is your firm’s responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA.  The specific violations noted in this letter and in the Inspectional Observations, FDA 483, issued at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of serious problems in your firm’s manufacturing and quality management systems.  Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of the violations, and take prompt actions to correct the violations and bring the products into compliance. ',\n",
